* Starter Kit Version Control
This part of the Emacs Starter Kit activates version control
modes. Comment out ones you don't need.

** Magit
It's to the point now where I almost can't use git without magit.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'magit)
  (define-key global-map "\M-\C-g" 'magit-status)
#+end_src

** aHg
aHg is a simple Emacs front-end for the Mercurial Distributed Source
Control Management system.

Its aims are simplicity and ease of use. It was inspired by DVC, but
it focuses exclusively on Mercurial instead of supporting multiple
Distributed SCMs.

A single mode for most distributed version control systems
